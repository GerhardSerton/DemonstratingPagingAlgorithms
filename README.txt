OS Assignment 1: Pieter Gerhard Serton

The wording of the assignment was vague, so I have assumed the following:
Calling the program with "python paging.py <number of pages>" will randomly generate a reference string of 10
values, to be used against the number of pages specified by the user.

Calling the program with "python paging.py <number of pages> <size of reference string>" will allow one to specify
the size of the reference string.
